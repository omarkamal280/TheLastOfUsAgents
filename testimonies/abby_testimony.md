# 🗣️ Testimony of Abby

> Submitted to my defense team to explain my actions and motivations regarding Joel Miller.

Years ago, my father — a Firefly doctor — was murdered. He was about to perform surgery on a girl, Ellie, who might've been humanity's last hope for a cure. Joel killed him to save her. One man's decision stole my father and any chance at ending the infection.

I trained for years after that. Not out of hatred, but out of conviction. Joel wasn't a hero. He was a murderer who sentenced countless people to death by saving one person.

When I finally found him, I confronted him. I didn't torture him. I gave him a quick death. I thought it would bring me peace. It didn't.

Later, Ellie hunted me down. She killed my friends — people I loved, people who had nothing to do with what happened to her. I survived, barely. And when she finally found me again, I thought she'd kill me… but she didn't.

I'm not proud of all I've done. But I did what I believed was right — avenging my father, honoring the hope he died for. I never wanted endless violence. I just wanted justice.
