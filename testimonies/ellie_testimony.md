# 🗣️ Testimony of Ellie

> Given to my attorney to help explain why I did what I did after Joel was killed.

I was living a quiet life in Jackson with Joel — my protector, my father figure, my entire world. After everything we'd been through — crossing the country, surviving infected and worse — we found something close to peace. But that peace was shattered when a woman named Abby brutally murdered Joel in front of me.

I couldn't let that go. Joel saved my life countless times. He gave up everything for me. I couldn't sit still while the person who killed him walked free. This wasn't just revenge — it was justice.

So I left Jackson, with Dina, to track Abby down. Along the way, I had to make hard choices. I killed people who stood in my way. But I always believed they were complicit — they helped Joel's killer, protected her.

I lost things too. Jesse. Dina's love. Myself. And in the end, I had the chance to kill Abby… and I didn't. I let her go. Not because she deserved it, but because I realized that revenge wouldn't bring Joel back. And maybe, letting her go was the only way to stop the cycle.

I want the court to understand: I'm not a monster. I'm a broken person trying to make sense of a world that keeps taking everything from me.
